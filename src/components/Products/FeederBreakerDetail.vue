            The Feeder Breaker is intended to Receive R.O.M Coal from L.H.Ds/Mine Cars and Feed the Coal on
            to the out-bye Conveyor after crushing the Coal to the required size.  The feed rate can be adjusted
            by varying the Feeder Breaker Conveyor speed. It has an Hopper capacity of 12 Cu.met. The drive is by
            Flame Proof 3-Phase Induction Motor operated by 550 Volts, 3-Phase Power supply.
          </p>

            The Feeder Breaker is mounted on a set of Crawlers through 4 nos Hydraulic cylinders. The Discharge
            end height and tilt can be adjusted by means of these Cylinders. The Crawlers are operated by
            Radio-Remote control during shifting of the unit from one place to another.

            The Chain conveyor consists of twin out board Roller chains connected by Flight bars and driven
            by Hydraulic Motor and Planetary reducer. The chains have a breaking strength of 70.Tonnes each.
            The Conveyor Trough is lined with CCO Wear Plates and the Bottom Plates are made of
            Abrasion Resistant (AR) Plates. The Chains tensioning is by Hydraulic means.
          </p>

            The Breaker unit consists of a Rotor whose shaft is mounted with heavy duty Bearings inside sealed
            housings having sliding provision for Breaker height adjustment. The crushing is done by TC Tipped
            cutting Picks housed in Pick holders through replaceable Pick Sleeves. Dust suppression is through
            water curtains containing spray nozzles.
