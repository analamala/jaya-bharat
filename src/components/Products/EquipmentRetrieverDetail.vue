            The Equipment Retriever is designed to assist the underground mining industry in the recovery
            of Continuous Miners (CM) involved in a roof collapse. It consists of a Base frame (Sled) and
            two main Cylinders. One cylinder called Staker Cylinder is hydraulically wedged between
            Mine Roof and Floor by attaching the required lengths of Staker extensions and prevents the movement
            of Sled during pulling. The Staker Cylinder is positioned at the required angle by a Lift cylinder
            called Pull Cylinder. One end of the Lift Cylinder is attached to the Sled and the other end of it
            is attached to the CM under collapsed roof through a series of Pull link assemblies. The trapped CM
            is then pulled out by repeated operations of the Pull Cylinder, each time by removing one Pull
            link assembly. The Hydraulic power required to operate the Cylinders is drawn from another Machine
            operating in the vicinity like Roof bolter and operated through the Retriever Hydraulic Control box
            containing Directional control Valves, Pressure Relief Valves and Pressure Gauges.
