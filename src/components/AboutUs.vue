    <v-card-text>
      The company is incorporated in the year 1995 with the vision to manufacture underground coal mining
      equipment with the highest quality and at a significantly lower cost compared to the equipment
      that is being imported by the mines. We started manufacturing Hydraulic Props, Legs and Valves for
      Powered Roof Supports and Armoured Conveyors. With vast experience in the manufacturing of mining hydraulic
      equipment and high tensile steel fabrications, we subsequently started providing services and developing
      equipment for other industries, including Construction. <router-link to="/contact">Contact Us</router-link>
